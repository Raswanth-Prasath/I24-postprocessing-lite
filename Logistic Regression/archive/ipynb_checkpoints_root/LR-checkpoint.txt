## Evaluating Features in Logistic Regression for Binary Classification

Here are the main approaches for feature evaluation in logistic regression:

### 1. **Coefficient Analysis**
- **Magnitude**: Larger absolute coefficient values indicate stronger impact (after standardization)
- **Sign**: Positive/negative coefficients show direction of association
- **Standardized coefficients**: Compare features on the same scale by standardizing inputs first

### 2. **Statistical Significance**
- **Wald test**: Tests if each coefficient is significantly different from zero (p-values from most ML libraries)
- **Confidence intervals**: 95% CI that doesn't include zero suggests significance
- **Likelihood ratio test**: Compare models with/without specific features

### 3. **Feature Importance Metrics**
- **Permutation importance**: Shuffle feature values and measure performance drop
- **SHAP values**: Show feature contribution to predictions (works well with LR)
- **Odds ratios**: exp(coefficient) shows multiplicative effect on odds

### 4. **Model-Based Selection**
- **L1 regularization (Lasso)**: Automatically zeros out less important features
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively removes weakest features
- **Sequential feature selection**: Forward/backward stepwise selection using AIC/BIC

### 5. **Performance Metrics**
- **AUC-ROC**: Compare models with different feature subsets
- **Cross-validation scores**: Assess feature stability across folds
- **Learning curves**: Diagnose if more features help or cause overfitting
